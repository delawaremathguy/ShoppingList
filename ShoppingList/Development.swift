// i added what i call a "Dev Tools" tab so that if you want to use this
// as a real app (device or simulator), access to all the debugging stuff that
// i have can be "controlled," so to speak, on a separate tabview; and that tab
// view can be displayed or not by setting this global variable:

let kShowDevToolsTab = true

// this boolean control whether the Shopping List is iniitally shown as multiple Sections,
// one Section per Location, or whether it shows only a simple list (items
// will still be listed in the same order, just not sectioned).  you can change
// this value here directly (i now have single section on by default).  the eager
// developer might want to put this value in UserDefaults ...

var gShowMultiSectionShoppingList = false

// i'm torn about this next setting.  i find it easier when i am in the store shopping to swipe
// to say "i just put that in the cart, take it off today's shopping list."  but
// SwiftUI only allows (even with WWDC2020 now in the rear view mirror) a traling
// swipe to be invoked by .onDelete(), and SwiftUI demands the label to be "Delete."
// you may want to change this behaviour.
// so i have code in the app based on the following boolean for whether a trailing
// swipe of ShoppingItems in a list means
//   (1) delete from Core Data
//   (2) remove from the current shopping list and place item into history/purchased list
//
// my default view of life is that a trailing swipe -- EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS DELETE -- means
// "move to the other list," so i set this boolean to false to choose option (2)
// change this flag to true if you want (1)

// note: THIS HAS BEEN DEPRECATED
// let kTrailingSwipeMeansDelete = false

// i used these constants and routines during development to import and
// export shoppingItems and Locations via JSON
// these are the filenames for JSON output when dumped from the simulator
// (and also the filenames in the bundle used for sample data)
let kJSONDumpDirectory = "/Users/USE_YOUR_OWN_MAC_USERNAME_HERE_HERE/Desktop/"	// dumps to the Desktop: Adjust for your Username!
let kShoppingItemsFilename = "shoppingItems.json"
let kLocationsFilename = "locations.json"

// to write stuff out -- a list of ShoppingItems and a list of Locations --
// the code is essentially the same except for the typing of the objects
// in the list.  so we use the power of generics:  we introduce
// (1) a protocol that demands that something be able to produce a simple
// Codable (struct) representation of itself -- a proxy as it were.
protocol CodableStructRepresentable {
	associatedtype DataType: Codable
	var codableProxy: DataType { get }

// and (2), knowing that ShoppingItem and Location are NSManagedObjects, and we
// don't want to write our own custom encoder (eventually we will), we extend each to
// be able to produce a simple, Codable struct proxy holding only what we want to write out
// (ShoppingItemJSON and LocationJSON structs, respectively)
